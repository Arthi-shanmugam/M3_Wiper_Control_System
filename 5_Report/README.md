# WIPER CONTROL SYSTEM
# ABSTRACT
Wiper is an essential component that used to wipe rain drops or any water from the vehicle's windscreen. Wipers are designed and made to clear the water from a windscreen.The previous system used to activate the wiper manually and the process of pulling up the wiper is difficult to be handled. The objective of this project are to upgrade the older cars system by providing automatic wiping system, to improve the system by using sensor with actuator and o design a basic program that will fully operate with the system. The proposed wiper system is similar with other existing conventional wiper. The automated rain wiper system is used to detect rainfall and activate automobile rain wiper automatically without driver interaction.This system is developed to mitigate driving distractions and allow drivers to focus on their primary task of driving. The distraction eliminated with the development of this product is the manual adjustment of windshield wipers when driving in precipitation. The few seconds that a driver takes their attention off the road to car accidents.The system uses a combination of impedence and rain sensor to detect rain and its intensity. The system contains a controller that takes in the input signals from the sensors and controls the operation of the windshield wipers based on those input signals.Finally the purpose of the project to design the windshield wiper control system for the safe of people to drive the vehicles.
